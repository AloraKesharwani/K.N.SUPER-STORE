  <b>3. PROFIT BY SUB- CATEGORY AND REGIONS:</b> 
  
</p>The profit by subcategories and region provides a variety of filters. The users can also filter the visualisations in the dashboard by region and sub-categories. The dashboard is dynamic, and the filter will be applied to all the visualisations available in the matrix chart.

  <b>4. PROFIT BY CATEGORY:</b> 
  
The profit by category chart gives managers the ability to have a wide range of information in just one chart, by drilling up they can have information about the overall profit of each product category and by drilling down they can find the most valuable products and the slow-mover ones. This can help production to put their resources into producing profitable goods and perhaps stop the production of goods with little to no profit

  <b>5. PROFIT BY STATES:</b> 
  Determining the top-performing state by analysing various metrics. By evaluating metrics such as total sales, customer acquisition, and profitability by state, businesses can identify the region contributing the most to overall success. This analysis guides strategic decisions, allowing businesses to focus resources, marketing efforts, and customer engagement strategies on the top-performing state for sustained growth and market dominance. Identifying and targeting top customers based on higher spending for special discounts and coupons is a strategic approach to cultivating preferred customer relationships.
